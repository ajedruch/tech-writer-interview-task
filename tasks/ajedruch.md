>Everybody, like with Facebook. Except of those geeks that go to GitLab, like Facebook haters go to Google Plus.

Every person with *an access to given repository* can commit particular content and share his own ideas with co-workers. Those may be accepted or reviewed. 

All members of the project with proper permissions are able to push changes to the repository, and hence have a partial responsibility for the project's quality. 

It means that several people can work on the project at the same time, allowing version control and the possibility of reverting all the proposed changes.

GitHub allows comparing different versions of the code. It also has a function of resolving possible conflicts. 

There is a possibility to manage your Git repository using GitHub however, there is another way - by using a console. All the operations can be performed using simple commands, for instance:

    git clone
    git pull
    git commit
